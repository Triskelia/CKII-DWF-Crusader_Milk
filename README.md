# Crusader Milk

## A Dark World Fantasy submod

The intent of this mod is to bring hucows and milking into Crusader Kings II.
It will requires the Dark World Fantasy mod in order to work, as it will be dependent on its breasts traits (and maybe other stuff too in the future).

### Requirements

- Crusader Kings II 3.0.1+
- [Not Yet] [Dark World Fantasy 1.4.2+](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7030-ck2-dark-world-fantasy/) (And its dependencies)

### Features

So far, not a lot to show as I'm still building the foundations of the mod.

- Decision to become a hucow (just adds the hucow trait for now)

### Planned Features

Short Term:

- Improved event chain to become a hucow (as well as turning others into one)
- Milking and Breast fullness system
- Drugs and herbs to alter someone else breasts or milk production (as well as arousal or other atribute)

Long Term:

- "Barn" management
- Milk Economy
- Milk Addiction
- Slavery integration
- Breeding
