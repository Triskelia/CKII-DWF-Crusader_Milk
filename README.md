# Crusader Milk
*A Dark World Fantasy submod*

The intent of this mod is to bring hucows and milking into Crusader Kings II.
It will requires the Dark World Fantasy mod in order to work, as it will be dependent on its breasts traits (and maybe other stuff too in the future).

## Requirements:
- Crusader Kings II 3.0.1+
- [Not Yet] [Dark World Fantasy 1.4.2+](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7030-ck2-dark-world-fantasy/) (And its dependencies)

## Planned Features:

Short Term:
- Being a hucow (or turning others into one)
- Milking and Breast fullness system
- Drugs and herbs to alter someone breasts or milk production (as well as arousal or other atribute)
- "Barn" management

Long Term:
- Milk Economy
- Milk Addiction
- Slavery integration
- Breeding
