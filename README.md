## A Dark World Fantasy submod

The intent of this mod is to bring hucows and milking into Crusader Kings II.

### Features

So far, not a lot to show as I'm still building the foundations of the mod. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, especially regarding localisation and game balance.

- Event chain to research on "Lacteria Mirifica", a mysterious mushroom, and turning yourself or another random woman into a hucow
  - You will need an alchemy building from Dark World in your capital, as well as the knowledge focus or a scientific/esoteric trait (like Erudite, Mystic...)
  - For now, the best way to experience this mod, is to be female and to do the experiments on yourself
- Basic breast fullness system (engorged breasts trait gained after some time)
- Decision to milk yourself if you have engorged breasts

This mod is fully localised in both English and French.

### Requirements

- Crusader Kings II 3.1.0+
  - (Recommended) Way of Life DLC
- [Dark World Fantasy](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7030-ck2-dark-world-fantasy/)
  - (Recommended) Dark World Fantasy Module - Dicks & Tits

### Compatibility

Should be compatible with anything as long as it doesn't conflict with the requirements above

### Instalation

To instal, copy the "Crusader Milk" folder and the "Crusader Milk.mod" file to your Crusader Kings II "mod" folder
> Type this in the explorer address bar to access it : *%HomePath%\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod*

### Planned Features

#### Short Term
